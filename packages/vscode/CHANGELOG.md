# Changelog

All notable changes to the CrabCode Visual Studio Code extension are documented
in this file.

## Unreleased

- Add `crabcode.computerUseMode` with background-application and foreground-desktop modes; explicit VS Code values override the Gateway mode without automatic fallback.
- Add Desktop-style composer capsules for reasoning effort, models, and modes.
- Add the seven reasoning effort levels and an Ultra toggle in the **+** menu,
  with a removable gradient capsule and bounded spectrum animation.
- Restore confirmed effort and Ultra settings per workspace, Gateway, and session.
- Support narrow sidebars, theme colors, keyboard effort selection, and reduced motion.
- Keep model and reasoning capsules on one adaptive row in narrow sidebars, and
  remove the redundant footer Agent/Plan selector now that Plan lives in the
  composer menu and active-mode capsule.
- Show active IDE context as a removable composer capsule, add a responsive
  **+ → IDE context** submenu for current-file and workspace file/folder
  references, and expose those references through composer `@` completion.

## 0.1.5

### Marketplace preparation

  documentation, plus this changelog.
